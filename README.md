# Planets 
Just a template for other projects based off my sketch:

> Currently only MacOS/Unix support, but I'll probably eventually make it cross platform.

![Example](./example.png)

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
Unix:
```
make
```
Windows. Depending on your compiler. I'm using MinGW compiling 32-bit:
```
mingw32-make
```
